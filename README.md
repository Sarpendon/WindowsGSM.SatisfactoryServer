# Changelog:
### 1.1
- **The plugin can be installed now.** The repository shipped the plugin as a nested
  `SatisfactoryServer.cs.zip`. WindowsGSM derives the target folder from the file name, so that
  zip landed in `plugins/cs.cs/` - and the loader, which looks for a `<Name>.cs` folder containing
  a matching `<Name>.cs` file, never found it. The plugin is now a normal `SatisfactoryServer.cs/`
  folder like every other plugin, so the repository's own zip download installs correctly.
- **Stopping the server now reaches it.** The stop signal was sent to the server's window with
  SendKeys, but WindowsGSM hides that window right after starting the server - so the keystroke
  went to whatever window happened to have focus on the machine, never to the server. Every stop
  ran into the timeout and ended in a hard kill. The signal is now raised on the server's own
  console, so it shuts down properly instead of being killed.
- The shutdown output stays readable for a few seconds instead of being cleared instantly.
- **Failed installs and updates now say why.** The reason was being swallowed and shown as an
  empty `[ERROR]`; a failed update additionally crashed with a `NullReferenceException`.
- A missing server executable is reported as such instead of a generic Windows error.
- Console output is read as UTF-8, so umlauts and other non-ASCII characters are no longer mangled.
